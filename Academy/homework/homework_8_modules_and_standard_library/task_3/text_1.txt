Create a Python module called `mymod.py`, which has three functions:
 count_lines(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number
 of lines in it (hint: file.readlines() does most of the work for you,
 and `len` does the rest) count_chars(name) function that reads an input
 file and counts the number of characters in it (hint: file.read() returns
 a single string) test(name) function that calls both counting functions with
 a given input filename. Such a filename generally might be passed-in, hard-coded,
 input with raw_input, or pulled from a command-line via the sys.argv list; for now,
 assume itâ€™s a passed-in function argument. All three `mymod.py` functions should
 expect a filename string to be passed in.
